## Project Title
A Morphological Generator for Southern Tati Verbs: Takestani Dialect

## Description
This program generates about the underlying morphological forms for about 67000 Takestani verbs: the abstract verb forms before being pronounced. 

The output of this project will be the input to the future versions of this program that will use Machine Learning for creating the surface forms of the verbs: how speakers actually pronounce verbs after all the phonological changes, including vowel harmony, apply to the underlying forms.

## Southern Tati language group
Southern Tati has been categorized by UNESCO as a "definitely endangered" language, meaning its transmission to  children has been halted and they no longer learn the language as their mother tongue. 

Tati, especially its complicated and fascinating system of verb morphology, has never been documented.This program contributs to the documentation of Tati by generating verb froms that have not be recorded anywhere. 

## Data
The program uses about 355 uninflected based forms for Tati verbs that I have gathered during several years of work on this language. The program iterates over every row (base form) and inflects the all the forms related to the available morpho-syntactic features.

## Morpho-syntactic features for verb inflections
Tense: past, present

Modality-present: indicative, imperative, subjunctive

Modality-past: indicative, subjunctive

Aspect-present: neutral, imperfective

Aspect-past: neutral, imperfective, perfect, pluperfect

Voice: active, passive

Polarity: negative, affirmative

Person: 1s, 2s, 3sm, 3sf, 1p, 2p, 3p

## Acknowledgments

Acknowledgements go to the instructor of the Data Science (5) bootcamp at Nashville Software School, Michael Halloway, for his kind and unconditional help with this program. Michael knew how important this program has been to me. He kindly met with me on a regular basis to help me set it up and run it. I also appreciate the role of Bryan Finlayson in helping me with this the program.
